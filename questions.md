```

Q9. Explain the key differences between value semantics and pointer semantics iteration in the provided code examples.

ANS: **Value Semantics**: In value semantic iteration (using for i, fruit := range strings), a copy of the original array element is assigned to the fruit variable within each loop iteration. This means any modifications to fruit won't affect the original array element. This approach creates multiple copies of the underlying data (string value) in memory, potentially for efficiency reasons.
**Pointer Semantics**: In pointer semantic iteration (using for i := range strings), the loop iterates directly over the indices of the original array. Inside the loop, strings[i] retrieves the element value by reference, meaning it points to the actual string in memory. This approach avoids unnecessary data copying but requires caution as modifying strings[i] would directly change the original array element.

Q10. What will be the output of below code?

```go
var five [5]int
four := [4]int{10, 20, 30, 40}
five = four
```

- A. The code will compile and assign the values of four to five.
- B. The code will compile and assign only the first 4 elements of four to five.
- C. The code will result in a compiler error because arrays of different sizes cannot be assigned.
- D. The code will result in a runtime error when the assignment is attempted.

ANS: C

Q11. When appending a new element to a slice in Go, what happens if the current capacity of the slice is insufficient?

- A. The append operation fails, and an error is returned.
- B. The element is directly appended to the existing slice, potentially overwriting existing data.
- C. The append function resizes the existing slice in-place to accommodate the new element.
- D. The append function creates a new slice with a larger capacity, copies the existing elements, and then appends the new element.

ANS: D

Q12. What will be the output of below snippet?

```go
slice1 := []string{"A", "B", "C", "D", "E"}
slice2 := slice1[2:4]
slice2[0] = "CHANGED"
fmt.Println(slice1)
```

ANS: [A B CHANGED D E]

Q13. What will be the output of below snippet and explain the why?

```go
slice1 := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
slice2 := slice1[2:4:5]

fmt.Printf("Slice: %v, Len: %d, Cap: %d", slice2, len(slice2), cap(slice2))
```

ANS: Slice: [3 4], Len: 2, Cap: 3
The syntax for a three index slice is [a:b:c] when b and c should be the same since
[a-b] sets the length and [a-c] sets the capacity.

Q79. Write a Go program using goroutines and channels that simulates alternating even and odd number printing. The program should:

- Spawn 2 goroutines: one for even numbers and one for odd numbers and print till 10.
- The even goroutine should:
  - Print even number received from the odd goroutine.
  - Send odd numbers to the odd goroutine using a channel.
- The odd goroutine should:
  - Print odd numbers received from the even goroutine.
  - Send even numbers to the even goroutine using a channel.

expected output:
even 0
odd 1
even 2
odd 3
even 4
odd 5
even 6
odd 7
even 8
odd 9

Q80. Write a program to print Map in sorted order by keys:

Q81. Write a Go REST API endpoint using the POST method. This endpoint should:

- Accept JSON data as input in the request body.
- Process the received JSON data (specific processing logic).
- Respond with a JSON object containing the processed data or an error message.
- Set appropriate HTTP headers (e.g., Content-Type: application/json).
- Implement field validation on the input JSON schema.
- Handle potential errors during JSON parsing, validation, or processing with informative error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error).

JSON Schema:

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "age": "integer"
}
```

Processing Logic:

The API endpoint can simply:

- Validate the received JSON data against the defined schema (using a library like encoding/json or a dedicated validation library).
- If valid, extract the "name" and "age" fields from the JSON object.
- Greet the user by name and indicate their age (e.g., "Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old.").
- Convert the greeting message into a JSON object.

Q82. Implement a Go program that defines a data structure called `Person` to store a person's name (string) and age (int). Additionally, create a data structure called `Stack` that utilizes a slice of `Person` structs to function as a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack.

The Stack should include the following methods:

- Push(p Person): Adds a person (p) to the top of the stack.
- Pop() (Person, bool): Removes and returns the person at the top of the stack. Returns a boolean indicating success (true) or failure (false) if the stack is empty.
- IsEmpty() bool: Checks if the stack is empty.
- IsFull() bool: Checks if the stack is full (reached its predefined capacity).

Q83. What is the primary purpose of profiling in Go?

- A. To identify and fix bugs in your code.
- B. To measure the performance characteristics of your code, such as execution time and memory usage.
- C. To improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
- D. To automatically generate unit tests for your functions.

ANS: B

Q84. Which type of profiling is most useful for identifying CPU bottlenecks in your Go program?

- A. Memory profiling
- B. Block profiling
- C. CPU profiling
- D. Mutex profiling

ANS: C

Q85. What are two common tools available for profiling Go programs?

A. `go build`and `go test`
B. `go tool pprof`and `goveralls`
C. `go tool pprof`and `goperf`
D. All of the above

ANS: C

Q86. How can you recover from a panic in Go?

- A. By using a `try...catch` block.
- B. By wrapping the potentially panicking code within a function that returns a custom error type.
- C. By using a `defer` function with a `recover()` call to handle the panic and potentially clean up resources.
- D. Panics are always unrecoverable and require restarting the program.

ANS: C
